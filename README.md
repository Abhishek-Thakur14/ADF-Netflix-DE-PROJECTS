# 📊 Netflix Data Engineering Project

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** for Netflix data using **Azure services**. It covers **data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, and analytics** using **Azure Data Factory, Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, and Apache Spark**. The pipeline is designed for scalability, efficiency, and real-time processing.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** → Orchestrates and automates the ETL pipeline.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** → Stores raw and processed data securely.
- **Databricks & Unity Catalog** → Manages data transformation, security, and governance.
- **Spark Streaming** → Processes real-time streaming data for live insights.
- **PySpark & Delta Lake** → Enhances data reliability, incremental loading, and performance.
- **Delta Live Tables** → Automates pipeline execution and ensures data consistency.
- **Databricks Workflows** → Automates scheduling and execution of pipeline tasks.
